# Banking-System-Testing

Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to manually test a Banking System that includes core functionalities such as user authentication, account management, transactions, loan processing, and security measures. The goal is to identify functional, usability, and security defects in the system before deployment.

Real-World Example: HDFC Bank NetBanking System

For this project, we consider HDFC Bankâ€™s NetBanking System as a reference. HDFC Bank is one of the leading banks, and its online banking system provides customers with various features such as account management, fund transfers, bill payments, and loan applications. Our manual testing approach ensures that a similar system functions seamlessly and securely.
